Enhanced bt Robot
-----------------

This is an enhanced robot (AI-driver) for the The Open Racing Car Simulator
(TORCS, www.torcs.org) based on the robot tutorial (www.berniw.org). You can
derive your own robot from this one with running the script "convert.sh". Run
it from this directory with "sh convert.sh". You find your robot one directory
above.
If you want to choose a name which does not match the pattern
^[a-z]+_200[4-9]$ you have to edit the script. The name you choose must work
as filename and as c function name, be careful if you change it.
Please do not remove any copyright notices from the files!

Bye, have fun,
